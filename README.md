## Functionality

This is the [linked lists](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/linked-lists) project, which serves to introduce data structures by creating linked lists.

## Methods

| Method        | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| #append(value)     | Adds a new node containing value to the end of the list |
| #prepend(value)     | Adds a new node containing value to the beginning of the list      |
| #size | Returns the total number of nodes in the list      |
| #head | Returns the first node in the list     |
| #tail | Returns the last node in the list     |
| #at(index) | Returns the node at the given index    |
| #pop | Removes the last element from the list    |
| #contains?(value) | Returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.     |
| #find(value) | Returns the index of the node containing value, or nil if not found.    |
| #to_s | Represent your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console.    |
| #insert_at(value, index) | Inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.    |
| #remove_at(index) | Removes the node at the given index.   |

## Thoughts

This really helped me understand and see the beauty in recursive methods. It also helped me deepen my understanding of data structures.
